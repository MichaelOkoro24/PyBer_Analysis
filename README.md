# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

As a newly hired data analysist for PyBer I've benn assigned my first big project to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a complling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize by using Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook, and matplotlib to make charts and graphs.

These Results show that the Urban area had the most drivers at 2,405 and the most money mad at 39,854.38 Then the Rural area had the least drivers at 78 and the least amount of total fares at 4,327.93. The Suburban was in the middle with 625 drivers and 19,356.33 in fares.



## Summary

The Rural and Suburban areas have way less drivers than urban areas due to the distance and population. Since the urban area is in a city there will be a way more influx of drivers meaning more money to make. To fix this we can better compensate drivers for trips that go to these areas to increase the total drivers numbers. Another way to solve this problem is to do a promotion where the drivers get 5% cash back on gas for doing long distance trips to rural and suburban areas.
